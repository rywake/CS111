my_beaglebone.jpg: A selfie of me holding my beaglebone

connected.png: I was unable to connect via USB into BeagleBone due to my Operating system not allowing me (running Mac OS Catalina). I did connect, however, using the command 'sudo screen sudo screen /dev/tty.usbmodemBBGW190101925'. This allowed me access to my beaglebone.

copy.png: This is a screenshot of me using the scp command in terminal to transfer my hello world program from my computer to the Beaglebone.

build_run.png: This is a screenshot of me using gcc in Beaglebone to compile my hello world c code, and then running it.

git.png: This is a screenshot of me using the apt-get function to install git, and then using the 'git clone' command to clone my GitHub repository to my beaglebone.

Makefile: Builds the tarball with all of the files above.
