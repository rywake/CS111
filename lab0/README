    In additions to the required files in the tarball, I added a test script "testScript.sh" that works with my 
'make check' function. When I run 'make check', the make function calls the test script to perform the necessary tests
to see if the program is running as expected.

Smoke-Test: For the smoke test in 'make check', I performed basic tests to make sure that the core function of the program
is running properly. This includes making sure that the function will exit with the proper exit codes, and will successfully
transfer the text from standard input to standard output. Some of the tests include:

"./lab0 --input" - to check to make sure it will catch that an argument is required.
"./lab0 --NotAnArg" to check if it will catch an invalid argument.
"./lab0 --catch --segfault" to check if it will catch the segfault
"./lab0 --catch --input=NotAFile" to check to see if it will catch the invalid file
"./lab0 --segfault" to check to see if the program will exit immediately after the segfault.

As well as other various tests to ensure the basic implementation of the code is performing as expected.
