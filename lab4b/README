List of files included in tar:

lab4b.c - Source code for the Beaglebone temperature sensor program. Reads the temperature sensor from the beaglebone and converts the temperature accordingly.
Makefile - compiles the code, deletes the executables and tar files when 'make clean' is run, and run a smoke test for the program
smoke.sh - runs test cases to ensure the programs basic functionality is running properly.

Research:
	I used the test program P4B_check.sh to help me create my smoke test file (smoke.sh).
