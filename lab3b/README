# File List
* lab3b.py:
     - source code that checks for corruptions in the file system CSV given
* Makfile:
     - default: builds the python file for execution
     - clean: removes the tar file and any executables created

# Extra information, comments

If a superblock or group entry are missing from the CSV, the script will exit with
the success return code (since no blocks or inodes are to be scanned).

For this project, we implemeneted the code using Python3 for its CSV interoperability and
idiomatic syntax.
